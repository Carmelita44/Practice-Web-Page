        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h5>Lead Crafter & <span>CEO</span></h5>
          <p> James Hall is a United States Air Force Veteran from San Diego, CA, who started his passion for Woodworking in 2015. It later became evident that there was a market for live edge furniture and custom wood home decor, so James started On Sight Woodworks LLC in 2020. On Sight is a zero waste brand which means repurposing trees and logs. James also owns Onsight Tree removal, where he removes dead and unwanted trees from homes and businesses in his local area and turns them into unique home designs.</p>
